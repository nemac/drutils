Nappl / Drutils
===============

`nappl`, which stands for 'NEMAC Application', is a program that
aids in application development and deployment.

This project contains the `nappl` program itself, plus the `drutils`
utilities for managing Drupal web sites.  The `drutils` utilities
are being phased out, and generally speaking, should not be used
any more, except to continue managing Drupal sites that have previously
been set up with `drutils`.  Most of the functionality of the `drutils`
scripts has been replaced with functionality in `nappl`, and new
development should take place with `nappl`.

The old `drutils` README file is still available as
[DRUTILS.md](https://github.com/nemac/drutils/blob/master/DRUTILS.md).
